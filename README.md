# The Arch Linux Development Package
This package is essentially the Arch Linux equivalent to the [`language-gentoo`](https://github.com/aegypius/language-gentoo) package of Nicolas Laurent. It provides syntax-highlighting for PKGBUILDs (with the help of the [`language-unix-shell`](https://github.com/fusion809/language-shellscript) package).
