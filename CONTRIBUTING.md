If you wish to suggest extra features this package could have please keep in mind the following points that could influence whether or not your proposed improvement can be implemented:

* Do the command(s) being executed in the improvement suggestion require input other than the path of the PKGBUILD presently opened? If it does, it may be difficult for me to implement.
* Is this improvement likely to benefit more people than just yourself? This is not intended to be rude, it is just if this is a personal preference-type improvement that isn't likely to be useful to anyone else I may not implement it.
